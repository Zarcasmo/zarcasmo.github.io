## Education					       		
- Master in electrical engineering	| Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira (_December 2023_)	 			        		
- Electrical engineer | Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira (_July 2020_)

## Work Experience
**Data Analyst and GIS Specialist | EDEQ - Energy Distribution Sub-Management (_October 2021 - Present_)**

As a Data Analyst and GIS Specialist, I manage data analysis and strategic planning for the operation and maintenance of electrical distribution networks. I lead projects that integrate quantitative and spatial analysis to optimize resources and enhance the reliability of the electrical system.

My work includes:
- Designing and executing analytical models using Python, SQL, and ArcGIS to prioritize maintenance across more than 5,000 km of network, focusing resources on the system's most critical areas.
- Implementing geospatial solutions for the analysis and mapping of assets and processes, generating key insights for strategic decision-making.
- Creating interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize key performance indicators and project results, improving decision-making processes.
- Automating administrative and operational processes, reducing time and costs with tools like Python and Excel.

**Junior Data Analyst @ EDEQ - Operational management area (_August 2020 - October 2021_)**

As a Junior Data Analyst, I supported the operations and quality department by analyzing data and generating strategic reports to optimize processes and ensure compliance with standards.

My work included:
- Processing and cleaning large volumes of operational data using Python, SQL, and Excel to produce accurate and timely reports.
- Analyzing operational and quality metrics to identify patterns and areas for improvement, optimizing system efficiency.
- Automating reports and repetitive tasks in Excel using VBA, enhancing team productivity.
- Collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to implement data-driven solutions that improved key performance indicators.

## Projects
### PowerGeoInsight-Comprehensive Analysis of Electrical Grid Failures
[Repository](https://github.com/Zarcasmo/PowerGeoInsight-Comprehensive_Analysis_of_Electrical_Grid_Failures)

This project focuses on identifying components that have experienced the most failures throughout a power distribution network. This is achieved by analyzing components that extend from the analysis point to the electrical substation that feeds them. To achieve this goal, a combination of data obtained from the database and SCADA system distribution event reports is employed. This information is interactively presented on a map using the Folium library.

On the generated map, size and color indicators are used to represent the events that have occurred at each circuit component. This visual representation allows for quick and intuitive identification of elements that have a significant impact on the failures perceived by the study element. It also facilitates decision-making and corrective action planning.
